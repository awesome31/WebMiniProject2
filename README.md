# Very Simple Seasons Project

Created a new react project, which takes the users current location using the geolocation API and the current month using the Date API and tell what season is the user currently in.

## React Concepts

- Created two seperate components: One to display the season and the other to display the Spinner component.
- Using hooks inside React projects to do async operations.
- Using props and state system of the React ecosystem efficiently.
- Clean and functional code with proper seperation of code.
